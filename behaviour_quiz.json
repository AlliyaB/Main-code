      "250mcg/litre of breath is the maximum permissible level, although it is recommended you don't drink at all before driving as any alcohol consumption affects your reaction times.",
      "You should keep your windscreen clean, and slow down or pull over until your eyes have adjusted to the light.",
      "You need to leave at least a 1.5m gap between your vehicle and a cyclist.",
      "Regardless of the direction you are approaching, you must slow down to 20kph if a school bus is letting children off, in case a child dashes across the road.",
      "3 seconds gives enough warning to other road users that you are about to move.",
      "Children can be unpredictable around vehicles as they don't always understand the dangers.",
      "A white cane indicates the person has impaired vision and may not be able to see your vehicle. Therefore, its better to stop and wait for them to cross.",
      "If you hold other drivers up, you may cause them to be frustrated which might lead them to try to overtake in a dangerous place.",
      "Let one car go, then go. This allows merging vehicles to slot into the gaps between vehicles already in the traffic flow, enabling them to maintain their speed. It also sets an expectation of how vehicles will enter a stream of traffic.",
      "It can take twice as long to stop in the wet because the road is more slippery. So, rather observe the four-second rule.",
      "Remember that cyclists have the right of way if they are riding straight through - you must not turn in front of them.",
      "Even though a vehicle coming uphill can (all things being equal) stop quicker, this rule ensures the vehicle travelling downhill, where stopping distances are longer, has to pay more attention.",
      "A good driver is well aware of what is happening around the vehicle and is able to predict what other drivers will do and build in a safety buffer to prevent accidents. Becoming a good driver takes practice and instruction from other good drivers such as a driving instructor.",
      "You can pass a vehicle in this situation as long as you stay to the left of the yellow line. Your wheels must not cross the yellow line. This allows you to get past slow vehicles which would normally pull to the left to help you overtake, e.g. tractors.",
      "Follow any instructions the farmer gives you. It's best to slow right down, or even stop, until the animals are past your vehicle."
