      "Before modifying your vehicle in any way, it's best to check with a WoF inspector that you won't be creating a problem for yourself in the future.",
      "The passenger is responsible. The driver is responsible for passengers under the age of 15.",
      "Space saver wheels are not as robust as normal tyres, they have much less grip and also force your differential to work harder, placing more wear on your car, because they are smaller than normal wheels.",
      "Drink driving is a serious offence. Drivers under 20 years old must not have any alcohol in their system. If you have more than 150mcg/litre of breath or 30mg per 100ml of blood then you could be disqualified from driving, given 50 demerit points and either fined or sent to prison.",
      "Ambulance and fire officers are there to assist in emergencies; a police officer can stop you if they think something is wrong with your vehicle.",
      "1.5mm is the minimum tread depth required for car tyres to get a Warrant of Fitness. However, wet weather performance drops off rapidly once tread depth is below 3mm.",
      "While you can drive on your own on a restricted licence, you must have a supervisor with you from 10pm to 5am.",
      "The exhaust and silencer should stop noise and gases from entering the car. The engine being in good condition will reduce the overall amount of pollution exiting the exhaust, and will ensure that there are no unnecessary mechanical and combustion noises. Of course, this question is moot if you have an electric vehicle as they have electric motors and no exhaust.",

      "The maximum speed for a car towing a trailer is 90km/h.",

      "You can carry a load that extends 4m behind the rear axle and 3m in front of the front edge of the front seat.",
      "The WoF shows that the vehicle was roadworthy when inspected. It's the driver's responsibility to ensure that the vehicle is maintained and is roadworthy all the time. The WoF label shows the expiry month and that it was inspected.",
      "The penalty for driving outside of the conditions of your restricted licence is 35 demerit points and a $100 fine. Breaching other licence restrictions attracts a $400 fine and 25 demerit points.",
      "Loads must be secure otherwise they could fall and cause a crash. You will be fined if you are caught with an insecure load."
