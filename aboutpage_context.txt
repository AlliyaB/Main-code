KiwiDrive mission statement: To improve New Zealand road safety knowledge in 
youth aged 15-24.

Teenagers and even those aged up to 24 are the most involved in car accidents, 
despite being the smallest group of road users. According to the New Zealand 
ministry of transport, 3,427 car crashes involved a young driver between the 
ages of 15 and 24. A whopping 83% of those crashes were the direct fault of a 
youthful driver. This highlights the significant impact our young drivers have. 
This is largely due to their lack of experience, skill, and knowledge which 
can cause them to make reckless decisions and get easily distracted.

Therefore, educating young drivers is crucial to mitigate the risks and 
reduce their involvement in car crashes. Through KiwiDrive, we have created 
reliable quizzes and tests adapted from AA road code and drivingtests.co.nz 
to ensure credability.

Here, we learn New Zealand road safety knowledge in a fun and engaging way 
which equips our youth with the confidence, knowledge, and experience to make 
smarter decisions on the road. Ultimately, creating safer outcomes.
