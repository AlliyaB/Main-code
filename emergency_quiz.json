      "Hitting the ball might send it into the path of another vehicle; swerving to the other side of the road creates another hazard.",
      "Do all you can to allow it to pass. Pulling to the left gives the ambulance more room and slowing down shortens the 'time exposed to danger', i.e. the time it takes to overtake you.",
      "You must tell a police officer as soon as possible, and within 24 hours.",
      "When the wheel has a blowout it suddenly becomes more difficult for the wheel to rotate, and also it is a smaller radius so this makes the car pull in direction of the blowout.",
      "If you want to learn car control when drifting or skidding, this should only be done on a track. While towing a trailer and only using dipped headlights where there are no street lights does increase risk, it's not inherently risky, and you can drive to the conditions by slowing down.",
      "A warning triangle can be put on the side of the road by anyone to warn other drivers of a breakdown or crash ahead.",
      "You should only use your hazard lights when your vehicle becomes a temporary hazard for other road users. You can tap the brake pedal to warn other drivers if you are in a queue of slow moving traffic or have had to stop suddenly.",
      "If you want to learn car control when drifting or skidding, this should only be done on a track. While towing a trailer and only using dipped headlights where there are no street lights does increase risk, it's not inherently risky, and you can drive to the conditions by slowing down.",
      "Red lights may operate outside airports and fire stations and you must stop until they have stopped flashing.",
      "If you see one, you know police are attending an accident.",
      "You should never park on the right facing traffic, and if your lights are out you will not be visible to other drivers and won't be able to see clearly where you are going.",
      "The lights and siren indicate it is attending an emergency.",
      "The back end is likely to first swing out the same side as the blowout, but will sway from side to side.",
      " If you've been observing the 12 second rule (looking around six cars ahead) you'll have a good idea of what the road is like up ahead, giving you enough time to anticipate any obstacles. Using the gap under the bonnet, and your vision through the side window, brake gently and pull over to the left. Then refasten the bonnet.",
      "Checking for injuries is important as it will allow you to seek medical help quickly if required."
